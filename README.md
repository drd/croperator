# Croperator

It's the basic cropping script with a stupid name for an outdated version of MooTools! I have a site with a bunch of MooTools 1.11 scripts and no time to convert them all, otherwise I would have just used MooCrop. But interestingly enough I had enough time to write this!

## TODO

- add control handles

Jan 28 09

+ split crop div into its own class
+ implement moving the crop box
