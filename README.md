# Croperator

It's the basic cropping script for the outdated JavaScript framework with a stupid name! I have a site with a bunch of MooTools 1.11 scripts and no time to convert them all, otherwise I would have just used MooCrop. But interestingly enough I had enough time to write this!

## TODO

- add options for ratio, etc
- add control handles
- add "matteing" like photoshop (darken non-cropped areas)

## DONE

+ get it working on IE (thanks [Kx5] and jabis on FreeNode#mootools!) (Jan 27 09)
+ initial version (Safari, Chrome, FF) (Jan 27 09)
+ split crop div into its own class (Jan 28 09)
+ implement moving the crop box
